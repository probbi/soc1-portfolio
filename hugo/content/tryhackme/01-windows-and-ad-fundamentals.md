**Alternate Data Streams ( ADS )**
  - Alternate Data Streams (ADS) are a feature of the NTFS file system in Windows that allow you to store additional metadata or hidden data within a file—without changing the file's apparent size or contents
- $DATA is the default stream type in NTFS (New Technology File System), and it's closely related to Alternate Data Streams (ADS)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>- Natively Window Explorer doesn't display ADS to the user
>- Used by attackers to hide malware or data in plain sight.

#### 5. The Windows\System32 Folders

The `C:\Windows` folder is the central directory of the Windows operating system - effectively the heartbeat of the system.

#### Content and significance:

 - It contains kernel files, system services, and all the essential files needed to run Windows.
 - Some of its sub-folders are key:
   - `System32`: contains all default system programs and .dll files.
   - `WinSxS`: stores the various versions of system components. 
   - `Logs,`Temp`,`Fonts`,`SoftwareDistribution`:for various logging, updating and configuration functions.
- Examples:
   - `notepad.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `taskmgr.exe` all run from the `C:\Windows\System32` folder.
   - Important variables such as `%windir%` are used to indicate the `C:\Windows` path.

#### 6. User Accounts, Profiles, and Permissions

User accounts can be one of two types on a typical local Windows system: Administrator & Standard User.
   - An **Administrator** has full control over the system. They can add or remove users, modify groups, install or uninstall software, and change system-wide settings.
   - A **Standard User**, on the other hand, has limited permissions. They can modify their own files and folders but cannot make system-level changes, such as installing applications or altering system settings. 

#### 7. User Account Control

**User Account Control** (**UAC**) is a Windows security feature that helps prevent unauthorized changes to the operating system. It prompts for permission or an administrator password before allowing actions that could affect system-wide settings or other users. UAC helps protect your system from malware and unintended system modifications by ensuring that only trusted changes are made.

#### 8. Settings and the Control Panel
