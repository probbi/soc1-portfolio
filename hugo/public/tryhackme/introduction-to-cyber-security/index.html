Careers in Cyber


📝 Notes
Offensive Security Intro

Preventing and detecting  intrusions (Blue Team)

Documenting and managing assets
User cyber security awareness
Updating and patching systems
Setting up preventative security devices
Setting up logging and monitoring devices



Defensive Security Intro

Security Operations Center (SOC)

Network intrusions
Policy violations
Unauthorized activity
Vulnerabilities


Threat Intelligence

Gathering information about potential adversaries


Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)

Digital Forensics (file system analyzing, system memory, system logs, network logs)
Incident Response (preparation, detection analysis, containment, eradication and recovery)
Post-Incident activity
Malware Analysis (viruses, trojan horses and ransomware,static and dynamic analysis)
Simulating a SIEM



Careers in Cyber

Security Analyst
Security Engineer
Incident Responder
Digital Forensics Examiner
Malware Analyst
Penetration Tester
Red Teamer


🐧 Conclusions
These introductory rooms were highly valuable, even with my prior IT background. They offered a clear and practical overview of both offensive and defensive security concepts, helping me better understand the mindset of ethical hackers and the critical functions of Blue Team roles. Exploring SOC operations, DFIR, and threat intelligence deepened my appreciation for how complex and structured defensive strategies are in real-world environments. This content helped me connect my existing knowledge with key cybersecurity principles and career directions.">
