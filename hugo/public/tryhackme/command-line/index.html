CMD vs PowerShell: CMD is text-based (like copy, echo). PowerShell returns objects (e.g., Get-ChildItem, Write-Output)\nPowerShell Basics Get-Content (read file content) – similar to type in CMD and cat in Linux. Set-Location (alias: cd) changes the current working directory, similar to cd in other shells. It’s useful when scripting or navigating file systems in PowerShell. Get-Help Run the Get-Help core cmdlet to invoke a built-in help system. Get-Command lists all available commands (including cmdlets, functions, aliases, etc.). It helps discover what commands are available and how to use them. cmdlet (pronounced “command-let”) Navigating the File System and Working with Files Get-ChildItem (ls, dir): Lists the contents of a directory. You can use it to see files and subfolders. Set-Location (cd): Changes the current working directory. New-Item: Creates a new item, such as a file or folder. Remove-Item (rm, del): Deletes files or folders. Get-Content (cat, type): Displays the content of a file. Piping, Filtering, and Sorting Data PowerShell uses piping (|) - Where-Object Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.CPU -gt 100 } Get-ChildItem | Select-Object Name, Length comparison operators Operator Meaning Example -eq Equal to $_ -eq 10 -ne Not equal to $_ -ne 10 -gt Greater than $_ -gt 5 -ge Greater than or equal to $_ -ge 5 -lt Less than $_ -lt 20 -le Less than or equal to $_ -le 20 Common Commands Sort-Object Get-Process | Sort-Object CPU Where-Object Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.CPU -gt 100 } Select-Object Get-Process | Select-Object Name, CPU System and Network Information Get-ComputerInfo - retrieves a comprehensive set of system details, including OS version, architecture, BIOS, and more Useful for checking OS, hardware specs, and system configuration\nGet-NetIPConfiguration - displays details about network interfaces, such as IP address, gateway, and DNS settings. Great for troubleshooting network settings or viewing adapter info.\nGet-LocalUser - lists all local user accounts on the machine. Useful for auditing user accounts or managing local users.\nReal-Time System Analysis Get-Process - displays all currently running processes on the system\nUseful for identifying resource usage and active programs. Get-Service - lists all services, including their status (Running, Stopped, etc.)\nHelpful for checking or managing Windows services. Get-NetTCPConnection - shows active TCP connections, including local/remote IP addresses and ports\nEssential for network diagnostics, identifying open ports, or spotting suspicious connections.\nScripting Invoke-Command -ComputerName RemotePC -ScriptBlock {Get-Service}\nThis command executes Get-Service on a remote computer named RemotePC. It returns a list of services running (or stopped) on that machine.\nLinux Shells Introduction to Linux Shells A Linux shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system by entering text-based commands. Common shells like Bash, Zsh, and Fish enable automation, scripting, and deeper control over system operations. How To Interact With a Shell? Most Linux distributions use Bash (Bourne Again Shell) as their default shell. pwd - Current working directory cd - Change Directory ls - List directory contents cat - Displaying file contents grep - Searching a word in file Types of Linux Shells echo $SHELL # command in Linux displays the default login shell for the current user cat /etc/shells # available shells in Linux chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh # permanently change your default shell (zsh) Bourne Again Shell (Bash) - default Shell in most Linux distributions Friendly Interactive Shell (Fish) - is known for its out-of-the-box usability, autosuggestions, syntax highlighting, and easy scripting without needing configuration. Z Shell (Zsh) - is powerful and highly customizable, often used with frameworks like Oh My Zsh, and is popular for its advanced features like better tab completion, globbing, and prompt customization. Shell Scripting and Components Key Components of a Shell Script: Shell scripting is a way to automate tasks in Unix-like systems by writing a series of commands in a script file, typically using shells like Bash, Zsh, or Fish. Shebang (#!/bin/bash) – Tells the system which interpreter to use. Comments (#) – Explain what the script or specific lines do. Variables – Store and reuse values. Defining the Interpreter # This script solution was part of a TryHackMe room (Linux Shells) # I did not write it myself — it's included here for reference and learning purposes. # Defining the Interpreter #!/bin/bash echo \"Please enter your name first:\" read name if [ \"$name\" = \"Stewart\" ]; then echo \"Welcome Stewart! Here is the secret: THM_Script\" else echo \"Sorry! You are not authorized to access the secret.\" fi The Locker Script A user has a locker in a bank. To secure the locker, we have to have a script in place that verifies the user before opening it. When executed, the script should ask the user for their name, company name, and PIN. If the user enters the following details, they should be allowed to enter, or else they should be denied access.\nUsername: John Company name: Tryhackme PIN: 7385 # This script solution was part of a TryHackMe room (Linux Shells) # I did not write it myself — it's included here for reference and learning purposes. #!/bin/bash # Prompting for user input echo \"Enter your Username:\" read username echo \"Enter your Company name:\" read companyname echo \"Enter your PIN:\" read -s pin # -s = silent input (not shown in terminal) # Checking credentials if [[ \"$username\" == \"John\" \u0026\u0026 \"$companyname\" == \"Tryhackme\" \u0026\u0026 \"$pin\" == \"7385\" ]]; then echo \"Authentication Successful. You can now access your locker, John.\" else echo \"Authentication Denied!!\" fi 🐧 Conclusions\nThis summary explains how to use command-line tools in Windows (CMD and PowerShell) and Linux. In Windows CMD, you can check system info, manage files, and fix network issues. PowerShell offers more advanced features like object-based commands, filtering, and scripting. In Linux, shells like Bash let you control the system, manage files, and write simple scripts for automation.\n",

<p>A user has a locker in a bank. To secure the locker, we have to have a script in place that verifies the user before opening it. When executed, the script should ask the user for their name, company name, and PIN.

This summary explains how to use command-line tools in Windows (CMD and PowerShell) and Linux. In Windows CMD, you can check system info, manage files, and fix network issues. PowerShell offers more advanced features like object-based commands, filtering, and scripting. In Linux, shells like Bash let you control the system, manage files, and write simple scripts for automation.</p>
